## Solving the second challenge

In the [Camilo's repository](https://github.com/camohe90/platziretoDNFT) you can find the complete challenge in spanish.

I took the original code and modified it to add 5 metadata changes, using Chainlinks oracles to achieve it. Then I deploy the contract. 

For this NFT I use the evolutions of a Pokemon to make it. Stages: Pokeball, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard and a flying Charizard.

The contract address is: 0xD6F357702084D01fA9648b5a11877f73B26E8168
