# Dynamic NFT

A Dynamic NFT (DNFT) is an NFT that can change its metadata. The change can happen because of many things â€“ especially external conditions. The major benefit of dynamic NFTs is their ability to evolve based on the real-world data changes delivered to the blockchain via oracles.

## Examples

Next, you can find two contracts as solution to this [Challenge](https://github.com/Oriplus/solidity-eth-challenge/blob/main/Retos.md) using an [IPFS](https://www.pinata.cloud/) for storage images and, metadata. Also,
[Keepers](https://keepers.chain.link/) to change dynamically the DNFT.
