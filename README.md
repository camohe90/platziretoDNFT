## Solving the second challenge

In the [Camilo's repository](https://github.com/camohe90/platziretoDNFT) you can find the complete challenge in spanish.

I took the original code and modified it to add 5 metadata changes, using Chainlinks oracles to achieve it. Then I deploy the contract. 

For this NFT I use the evolutions of a Pokemon to make it. Stages: Pokeball, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard and a flying Charizard.

The contract address is: 0xcc10bD4F94e3ee35301f54937125ECa8aD47481D

Etherscan: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xcc10bd4f94e3ee35301f54937125eca8ad47481d
